# Lines beginning with hash are comments, to be ignored
# Empty lines like above and below are also to be ignored
# Config file specifies the graph in adjacency matrix format
# Only right-upper triangle is specified, as link costs are symmetric in either  direction
# Cost of -1 implies infinite cost (not a neighbour)
# Each entry is separated from next by a tab, for readability
# Tabs at the beginning of a line are to be ignored (for readability - see below)
# First row is for virtual node A, next for B, and so on
# Example matrix for the example network shown in instructions is below
# Costs from A to B, C, D, E
3       1       -1      -1
# Costs from B to C, D, E; note the tab at the beginning, to overall give view of upper-right triangle
        2       4       -1
# Costs from C to D, E
                -1      1
# Costs from D to E
